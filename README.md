# Animal-Face-Recognition-CNN

A Deep Learning project to identify Animal using Convoluted Neural Network. This is an image recognition project that includes images preprocessing, modeling, model improvement and deployment.

The base model already achieve a good result of 90% accuracy, the improvement increase the accuracy to 96% which shows that the model is very good at differentiating animal types. Further improvement can still be made by perhaps using pre-trained model to achieve even higher accuracy.
